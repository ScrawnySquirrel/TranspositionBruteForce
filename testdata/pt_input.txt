I failed my way to success.
An unexamined life is not worth living.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.
Live in the sunshine, swim the sea, drink the wild air.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.
I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't. It's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere.
People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed and the more they find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
